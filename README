Written and maintained by Nikos Chantziaras <realnc@gmail.com>

Hugor is a "Hugo Runner", meaning a program in which you can load and play
adventure games created with Kent Tessmanâ€™s Hugo authoring system:

Hugor supports all graphics, sound and music formats of the Hugo engine.
Video, however, is not (yet?) supported.

It runs on all current major operating systems (Linux, Mac OS X and
Microsoft Windows).  You can find up to date, ready to run binaries at:

The source code is hosted at the following Git repository:

If you wish to build from source, you will need the development packages
for the Qt library (version 4.4 or later) and SDL_mixer or FMOD.  SDL_mixer
is recommended and you'll need at least version 1.2.12.  To get correct
support for MOD and MP3 music, SDL_mixer needs to have been built with
modplug and libmad support.
