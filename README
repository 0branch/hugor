Hugor - A portable Hugo engine
Written and maintained by Nikos Chantziaras <realnc@gmail.com>

Hugor is a "Hugo Runner", meaning a program in which you can load and
play adventure games created with Kent Tessmanâ€™s Hugo authoring system:

Hugor supports all graphics, sound and music formats of the Hugo engine.
Video is fully supported in the Linux version.  In order to be able to
play videos, you will need the correct GStreamer plugins/codecs installed.
The gstreamer-ffmpeg plugin should be a safe bet.

(For runtime library dependencies of the distributed Linux binary, please
consult the README.linux-bin file.)

Hugor runs on all current major operating systems (Linux, Mac OS X and
Microsoft Windows).  You can find up to date, ready to run binaries at:

The source code is hosted at the following Git repository:

Compiling from source
=====================

If you wish to build from source, you will need the development packages
for the Qt library (version 4.4 or later; 4.5 or newer is *highly*
recommended), SDL_mixer (at least 1.2.12) and QtGStreamer.   To get
correct support for MOD and MP3 music, SDL_mixer needs to have been
built with modplug and libmad support.

Once all dependencies are installed, you can build Hugor with the
following commands:

  qmake
  make -jN

Substitute the 'N' in '-jN' with the amount of CPUs or cores in your
system in order to utilize all of them for a faster compilation process.
(If you are not using GNU Make, then the -j option might not be supported.
If that's the case, simply omit that option altogether.)

If all goes well, you will find an executable in the current directory
which you can copy somewhere else and run it however you want.
