Written and maintained by Nikos Chantziaras <realnc@gmail.com>

Hugor is a "Hugo Runner", meaning a program in which you can load and
play adventure games created with Kent Tessmanâ€™s Hugo authoring system:

Hugor supports all graphics, sound and music formats of the Hugo engine.
Video, however, is not (yet?) supported.

It runs on all current major operating systems (Linux, Mac OS X and
Microsoft Windows).  You can find up to date, ready to run binaries at:

The source code is hosted at the following Git repository:

Compiling from source
=====================

If you wish to build from source, you will need the development packages
for the Qt library (version 4.4 or later; 4.5 or newer is *highly*
recommended) and SDL_mixer or FMOD.  SDL_mixer is recommended and you'll
need at least version 1.2.12.  To get correct support for MOD and MP3
music, SDL_mixer needs to have been built with modplug and libmad
support.

Once all dependencies are installed, you can build Hugor with the
following commands (substitute "sdl" for "fmod" if you want to use the
FMOD sound backend):

  qmake SOUND=sdl
  make

If all goes well, you will find an executable in the current directory
which you can copy somewhere else and run it however you want.
